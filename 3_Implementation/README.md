Working :
   When the circuit is powered ON, the Arduino will start measuring the distance of the objects in front of the Ultrasonic Sensor.
It will calculate the distance is less than 100cm, then Arduino activates the buzzer. We can Modify the code according to your convenience so that,
it beep the buzzer so that the intensity of the beeps increases with a decrease in the distance (like in a real car).
